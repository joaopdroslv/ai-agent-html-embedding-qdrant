## What Is Overlap in Embedding Spaces?

In embedding space, **overlap** refers to the phenomenon there **different inputs are mapped to very similar or identical vectors**, making them **hard to distinguish** during similarity research.

Think of it as:
Two or more **semantically different** items end up being **numerically close** in vector space.

This is **not ideal**, especially for tasks like:
- Semantic search
- Classification
- Recommendation

### Technical Cause of Overlap

**Overlap usually happens when:**
- **Embedding size is too small** -> limited space to encode nuances
- **Model isn't powerful enough** -> fails to differentiate concepts
- **Training data is too generic or biased**
- **Input data is noisy or ambiguous**

### What Overlap Looks Like in Practice

Suppose you embed these two texts:
```txt
A: "How to train a dog"
B: "How to cook a lasagna"
```

In a **very small embedding space (e.g., 64D)**, the model might not have the capacity to discriminate between those topics. So both get vectors that are close, like:

```python
vector_a = [0.1, -0.3, 0.5, ...]
vector_b = [0.11, -0.29, 0.48, ...]  # nearly identical
```

As a result, searching for **"how to train a puppy"** might return lasagna recipes.

This is overlap in action.

### How to Reduce Overlap

| **Strategy**               | **Description**                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Increase embedding size    | More dimensions = more room to spread points apart  |
| Use stronger embedding models | Less likely to have problems differentiating concepts |
| Add task-specific fine-tuning | Train embeddings on your domain/task |
| Normalize inputs | Clean/preprocess text (remove noise)
| Filter low-quality data | Ambiguous or generic inputs are more likely to overlap |
