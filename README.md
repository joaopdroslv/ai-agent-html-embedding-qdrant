## ðŸ§  AI Embedding & AI Agents Playground

This project is a learning and experimentation environment designed to explore and improve concepts related to **embeddings**, **vectorization**, and **AI agents**, with a focus on using **Pydantic AI** and **Qdrant** as a vector database.

The application is built using **FastAPI** and provides several endpoints to interact with embeddings, perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and run agent-based responses.

### ðŸš€ Features

- Embedding generation and storage with Qdrant
- Retrieval of semantically similar documents (RAG)
- AI agent-based answers using Pydantic AI
- REST API built with FastAPI for interaction
- Schema validation with Pydantic

### ðŸ§  Project Goals

This repository serves as a personal lab for:
- Understanding how embeddings are generated, stored, and queried
- Building reliable and structured AI agents
- Experimenting with context-aware response systems (RAG)
- Gaining experience with vector DBs and prompt engineering

### ðŸ“Œ Notes
- The project is still **under active development**.
- Only **basic error handling and validation** are in place.
- Ideal for **research, experimentation, and local use**.
