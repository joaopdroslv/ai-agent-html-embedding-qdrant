# ðŸ§  AI Embedding & AI Agents Playground

This project is a learning and experimentation environment designed to explore and improve concepts related to **embeddings**, **vectorization**, and **AI agents**, with a focus on using **Pydantic AI** and **Qdrant** as a vector database.

The application is built using **FastAPI** and provides several endpoints to interact with embeddings, perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and run agent-based responses.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Embedding generation and storage with Qdrant
- Retrieval of semantically similar documents (RAG)
- AI agent-based answers using Pydantic AI
- REST API built with FastAPI for interaction
- Schema validation with Pydantic
